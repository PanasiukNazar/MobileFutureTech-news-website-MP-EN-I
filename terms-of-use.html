                    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in
                        accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which we
                        operate, without regard to its conflict of law
                        principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive
                        jurisdiction of the courts located in that jurisdiction
                        to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms or
                        your use of the website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access
                        to the website at our sole discretion, without notice,
                        for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is
                        harmful to other users or our business interests. Upon
                        termination, your right to use the website will
                        immediately cease.
                    </p>

                    <h2>11. Miscellaneous</h2>

                    <h3>11.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement
                        between you and us regarding your use of the website and
                        supersede any prior agreements or understandings,
                        whether written or oral.
                    </p>

                    <h3>11.2 Severability</h3>
                    <p>
                        If any provision of these Terms is found to be
                        unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited
                        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that
                        the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in
                        full force and effect.
                    </p>

                    <h3>11.3 Waiver</h3>
                    <p>
                        No waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall
                        be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
                        any other term, and any failure of us to assert a right
                        or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
                        waiver of such right or provision.
                    </p>
